To install CATS you need to have git and sudo installed:

# apt-get install git sudo

User, under which you will deploy CATS should be in sudoers (sudo group).
Clone this repo:

$ git clone git://github.com/klenin/cats-main.git

Look at deploy.bash, adjust, if needed, http_proxy (and set env_keep in 
/etc/sudoers, see comments in deploy.bash) and group, that your apache runs
under. Then simply execute script:

$ ./deploy.bash

And if everything is ok you should copy Connect.pm.template to Connect.pm in
cgi-bin/CATS/ and adjust connection settings to your DB. Congratulations, you
now have a working CATS setup.
